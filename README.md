### Bugs
+ **Solved bugs**


1. The function that initiates the flipping of a flashcard did not allow the click on the pronunciation buttons to listen to the correct pronunciation of a word.

    - *Solutions:* Add ```event.stopPropagation();``` method to the speakFunction(), which takes two parameters: event and lang.
    
1. The audio played '/' as "slash" for the words that had two spelling variations.
        
    - *Solution:* Add ```replace();``` method with two parameters ```currentWord.replace('/', 'or');```to the speakFunction().

1.  The settings for input required in spelling_quiz.html did not work; therefore, if the input was empty, the user could check the spelling without typing a word in the input area.

    - *Solution:* Add if-else statement to the checkSpelling function that disables Check button if the input is empty and enable Check button if the input is not empty.

```js
const checkSpelling = function () {

  let answerInput = document.querySelector('#word__key--input');
  if (answerInput.value === '') {
    btnCheck.getAttribute("aria-disabled") === "true";
  } else {
    document.getElementsByClassName('word__key')[0].innerText = currentWord;
    btnCheck.getAttribute("aria-disabled") === "false";
    if (answerInput.value.toLowerCase() === currentWord) {
      answerInput.style.backgroundColor = '#008a5a';
    } else {
      answerInput.style.backgroundColor = '#c26ee3';
    }
  }
}
```
