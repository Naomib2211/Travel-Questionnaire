##  Design Processes

- The design vision for this project were simplicity and a retro feel. A background image of a globe where Europe is centered was chosen. Colors were extracted from this image to create a simple yet cohesive feel to the questionnaire. Choice of fonts were based on the association of older style design choices for websites. 

### Font Design

- 'Karla' and 'Merriweather' for fonts of this app. Based on the creators associations to older style questionnaires, these two fonts were chosen as they complimented each other. 

+  [Karla](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Karla#styles) was used for the emphasized, "important" sections, such as H1, start/restart- buttons and questions


![Karla](documentation/karla-font.png) 


+ [Merryweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather#styles) was used for the rest, less emphasized sections, such as the paragraphs and the texts in the option-buttons.

### Colour Scheme

- As previously explained, these colors were chosen based on the background image of the website. Specifically these colors to create harmony but also enough contrast for accessability.

- I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/ffffff-f2ceae-bf4b21-7e3217-000000) to generate my color palette.

- Here is the image the colors and the over style for this website was based on

## The project features

### Introduction

+ Below image shows the introductory start page. 
    * Descriptive title
    * Less descriptive body of text, serving the purpose of intruiging the visitor into the questionnaire, rather than describing what it is. Last pragraph describes how to start the questionnaire.
    * Has two button features:
        * 'START' button which leads the visitor to the start of the questionnaire
        * 'RESTART' button which leads the visitor ta refreshed page, at this stage.

### The Quiz

+ Below image shows the structure of the questionnaire
    * First section presents the question for the visitor to answer, it also presents which number of question the visitor is currently on. 
    * Second section shows the descriptive options, where the visitor chooses which option suits them the best based on the question presented above the options. When the visitor chooses an option it will be directed to the next question. This will go on until the last (10th) question, at which it will calculate the points the visitor has gathered answering all the questions. 
        * The option section is significant as this is the main feature that will create returning visitor,  it reshuffes the order of options everytime so that if the visitor wants to redo the questionnaire it won't be as predictive right away. 
    * Last section shows the 'Restart' button that will, at any point in time the visitor wants to restart the questionnaire it will lead the visitor to the introductional start page.

### The Result

+ Below image presents the result section of the questionnaire. This section rewards the visitor for going through the test with "travel-personality" description, based on chosen options to the visitor. Here one gets to see the suggestion to different destinations in Europe based on ones needs and wants.
    * The first section presents title of the visitor's "travel-personality" based on the previously answered questionnaire. In the image below the personality "Tourist" is shown. This feature was created to emphasize the feel of retro questionnaires from earlier, but also to regular personality-quizes that many are familiar with even today.
    * The second section serves to give a deeper explanation to the resulted "personality" that was given to the visitor. This section also serves a similar purpose to the title - to describe the personality trait that the visitor has based on the questions answered.
        * As people we are always curious of the world, but we are also curious of ourselves. Here the visitor will enjoy learning more about themselves whilst also learning where they could potentially travel to to enjoy themselves.
        * The most important feature here, besides the descriptive text is the result destination that the visitor gets. Another feature here is added in order for the visitor to come back multiple times. Multpiple European cities were added for each "travel-personality", so that when the visitor comes back to redo the test, they are presented with other travel destinations despite maybe answering identically in the questionnaire. So, here is another shuffling-feature.
    * The last section has, just like the other parts, the 'RESTART' button. For the visitor to redo the questionnaire over and over again. It's also always there in case the visitor wants to redo the questionnaire at any point in their progress.

### Future Features

- Add the [Dialog](https://blog.webdevsimplified.com/2023-04/html-dialog/) element, an interactive popup for creator's credit

- Suggest links to flights and living options based on visitors result 

- Make the results page more organic and "painting the picture", with images based on the given "travel-personality", connected to suggested links to flights and living option.
